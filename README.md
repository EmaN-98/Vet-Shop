# Vet-Shop

Objective

The objective of this assignment is to allow students to become familiar with the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern and the Factory Method design pattern.

Application Description

Use Java or C# to design and implement a desktop application for Veterinary Lab. The application should have two types of users (a regular user - the doctor/employee - and an administrator user) which have to provide a username and a password in order to use the application.

The regular user can perform the following operations:
CRUD on consultations
CRUD on animals involved in consultations
Search the list of consultations/animals

The administrator can perform the following operations:
CRUD on animals
CRUD on regular users' information.
Generate two types of report files, one in pdf format and one in txt or html format, with the consultations details. The reports need to be saved in a user-selected location (not predefined by the application), similar on how one would save a file from Notepad.
